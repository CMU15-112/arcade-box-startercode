Hi!  I'm the 15-112 Arcade Box.  My job is to play 15-112 term projects.  Please follow these simple rules when using me:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Most games can be quit by pressing the ``P1" button.
\item If a game is locked up and unable to quit, you can press ``reset".  (But please avoid this, because it might corrupt my file system.)
\item 15-112 students who want to port their games to this box should contact Prof. Riley.
\item Please don't connect or disconnect things from me, including USB devices like keyboards.  If you have debugging issues, please contact Prof. Riley.
\item Please don't break me or load other software onto me.

\end{enumerate}
